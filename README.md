Hey. Welcome to this repository. You just found the very first file, which also happens to be the project `README`.

Everything written here comes from my **Obsidian Vault** and is synced with this git repo thanks to the `Obsidian Git` plugin. Cool stuff. 

While you're here, why not read the very first article?
